## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## For a given matrix, first look up in the cache whether its inverse
## has been calculated or not. If yes, use the existing one; if not, calculate
## the inverse and store in the cache

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getInverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
 
}

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
##makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and 
##the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
##inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setInverse(m)
  m
  
}
